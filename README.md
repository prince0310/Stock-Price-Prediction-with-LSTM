# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM

LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory Networks. It is a type of recurrent neural network that is commonly used for regression and time series forecasting in machine learning. It can memorize data for long periods, which differentiates LSTM neural networks from other neural networks. If you want to learn how to predict stock prices with LSTM, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through the task of stock price prediction with LSTM using Python

Using LSTM is one of the best machine learning approaches for time series forecasting. LSTMs are recurrent neural networks designed to remember data for a longer period. So, whenever you are working on a problem where your neural network fails to memorize data, you can use LSTM neural network. You can read more about LSTMs
